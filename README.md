# Audicin API - Heart Rate Based Song Recommendation

## Overview

The **Audicin API** is a RESTful API that recommends music tracks based on a user's heart rate. It processes heart rate data from Apple Watch HealthKit (or similar sources) and returns a track with suitable binaural beats to match the user's mental stateâ€”whether it's for relaxation, focus, or creativity.

The recommendations are made from a predefined track dataset, each linked to a specific brainwave frequency (Gamma, Beta, Alpha, etc.) that corresponds to different cognitive and emotional states.
